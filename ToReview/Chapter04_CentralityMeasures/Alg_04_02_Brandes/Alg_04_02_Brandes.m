% Description: Computes the vector containing the Freeman's centrality scores
%              using Brandes's algorithm.
%
% INPUT:
% ------- 
% - C: the (n x n) cost matrix of a directed graph.
%      To allow a sparse matrix to represent C, components 0 in C are taken
%      as Inf; that is, corresponding edges are nonexistent.
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------
% - bet: The (n x 1) vector of betweenness scores.
%
% NOTE: Requires PriorityQueue.m.

end

% N.B. According to the original definition of Freeman's betweenness,
% 'bet' must be halved for undirected graphs, but this process is omitted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description: A veriation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm that

% 
% INPUT:
% -------

%          to each node
% - pred : (n x n) binary matrix representing the shortest-path DAG
%          pred(i, j) == 1 implies that node j is a predecessor of
%          node i on a shortest path from the origin
% - S    : list of nodes reachable from the origin, in decscending order
%          of the distance from the origin (i.e., furthest first, origin
%          last)
