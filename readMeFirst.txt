Moreover, they are provided “AS IS”, that is, without any warranty or liability of any kind for the developers.We chose Matlab because (i) there is an open source equivalent (Octave), (ii) it handles sparse matrices, and (iii) it is a high-level, compact, user-friendly language providing all the necessary matrix operations.Current status (26/10/2018): The availability of the code is in progress. The developers first provide the code, which is then reviewed and revised by one of the main developers (which include the authors). Currently, the draft code for some chapters is already available but still needs to be reviewed. Our priority now is to review and revise the existing code. Then, we will pursue the effort with the other chapters.Structure of the repository: there are two directories, "ToReview" and "Reviewed". The "ToReview" directory contains draft code that has not been reviewed yet while "Reviewed" contains code that has been revised by one of the main developers.Citing the work: If you use the code, we would be pleased if you cite the book:@BOOK{FoussSaerensShimbo-2016,  author = {F.
