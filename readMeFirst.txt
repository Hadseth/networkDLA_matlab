+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Matlab code files for the book: François Fouss, Marco Saerens and Masashi Shimbo (2016). "Algorithms and models for network data and link analysis".Cambridge University Press.GitHub site https://github.com/MarcoSaerens/networkDLA_matlab+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Current contributors: Marco Saerens (UCL), Guillaume Guex (UCL), Bertrand Lebichot (UCL), Sylvain Courtain (UCL), Pierre Leleux (UCL), François Fouss (UCL), and Masashi Shimbo (NAIST).Code: The Matlab/Octave code of most of the algorithms will be made available gradually on a web site like GitHub and made accessible from the Cambridge University Press web page for the book (\url{http://www.cambridge.org/9781107125773}).Note that algorithms and code are provided for educational purposes & readability and are therefore not optimized. Moreover, they are provided “AS IS”, that is, without any warranty or liability of any kind for the developers.We chose Matlab because (i) there is an open source equivalent (Octave), (ii) it handles sparse matrices, and (iii) it is a high-level, compact, user-friendly language providing all the necessary matrix operations.Current status (26/10/2018): The availability of the code is in progress. The developers first provide the code, which is then reviewed and revised by one of the main developers (which include the authors). Currently, the code for some chapters is already available but still needs to be reviewed. Our priority now is to review and revise the existing code. Then, we will pursue the effort with the other chapters.Citing the work: If you use the code, we would be pleased if you cite the book:@BOOK{FoussSaerensShimbo-2016,  author = {F. Fouss and M.
